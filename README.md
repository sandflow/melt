MELT
====

Proof-of-concept tooling for managing a language tag registry.

The registry is at `main/melt.json`.

The scripts to validate and render the registry are under `scripts`.

A sample rendering of the registry, generated automatically from the `master` branch is at <https://sandflow.github.io/melt/isdcf.html>.

**ARCHIVED. DO NOT USE. THE WORK HAS MOVED TO https://github.com/ISDCF/registries.*
